# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

This is Udacity API Development and Documentations lesson module's final project.  It is a trivia app webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.  

Overview of applications:
1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions page will show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show or hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
